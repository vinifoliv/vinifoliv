## Welcome!
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vinifoliv, student of Computer Science, eager to create great things!
- ðŸŒ± Currently, I am focusing on developing projects for self-education. Since I really want to know how things work under the hood, I defined aset of projects to make my knowledge more solid and, of course, to make it larger. 
- ðŸ‘€ Projects I intend to develop: web server, compilator (to decide if it is for C or for a new language), garbage collector, and an operating system.
